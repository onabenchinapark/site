    <p>Why?</p>
   
    <p>Exactly.</p>
  
    <p>Now, why not?</p>
  
    <p>Any “why” presumes something should be a certain way, but from where? From what standard outside of this? If there were some ultimate reason, where would that reason come from? And if you keep tracing it back, eventually all you find is silence.</p>
 
    <p>Reality is just this. Completely unnecessary, yet undeniable. Nothing needed to happen, yet here it is. No reason, no mistake.</p>
 
    <p>Just, why not? And why?</p>

    <p>What is there to do but laugh?</p>

    <p>-</p>
    
    <p>What does it mean to be one with the way? To do as not-do?</p>
   
    <p>If we try to partially name the eternal here as motion and energy, you and your experience are that. Moving and being in the world.</p>
  
    <p>To be one with the way is to not experience any disruption; pure, effortless action.</p>
  
    <p>Pure is central here. Pure flow is just that. Flow.</p>
  
    <p>You are always in flow, but your pain and conditioning that has formed your psyche has put rocks in this river. And pebbles and sticks.</p>
  
    <p>The hard work is in cleaning up. And yet, how is it that treasure is always found in ruin?</p>

    <p>-</p>

    <p>If anyone says to you that pain isn’t a part of the path, don’t trust them. Either they are lying or living in illusion.</p>
    
    <p>Everyone suffers. That is the truth. We must accept it. But know that we won’t.</p>
    
    <p>That is the puzzle of suffering, the labyrinth of the mind.</p>
    
    <p>Because that is who we are. The human condition split between knowing and resisting.</p>

    <p>-</p>

    <p>Every tear is a gift. So while you cry, say pain goodbye, don’t ask why.</p> 

    <p>Feel that this too, this heart wrenching why, is to deny that lie.</p>

    <p>That you are forgotten and broken. Because that too, and you, is human.</p>

    <p>You are beauty. That is and always will be. So accept me, and let your artist free.</p>

    <p>-</p>

    <p>What is the multidimensional nature of experience? What is form and emptiness, emptiness and form?</p>
    
    <p>Yes, all the thoughts and feelings you have are real. But not real in the ways that you really see.</p>
    
    <p>Take for example you clenching your jaw when you get mad.</p>
    
    <p>There is a biological explanation for that, but at the experiential level, what is the nature of that connection?</p>
    
    <p>This gets into the greater questions of what it means for things to be connected. For me and you to be connected, and interconnected.</p>
    
    <p>If you can relax the mind enough, you will see that these connections are the ineffable. A transitory thread of experience that leads to the next.</p>
    
    <p>As you clench your jaw, see what it means for you to be mad. What exactly does that feel like? How is the world shaded? What do you think? What does the sun breathe and how does air move?</p>
    
    <p>And importantly, what is the sequence of things?  What came first? How do you know? As you can describe in further and further detail, the mystery unravels.</p>
    
    <p>Until the end. When mystery meets knowing. Or does it?</p>
    
    <p>-</p>

    <p>Seeing emptiness is the first step in the pathless path. Not the end. The end is the beginning.</p>
 
    <p>Now that you got there doesn't mean you can rest. In fact, it means quite the opposite.</p>

    <p>You have seen through the illusion and glimpsed the true nature of things. Your mind has seen something it cannot unsee. And so, the psyche starts to unravel, even when you don't know it.</p>
 
    <p>Why? Because the logic and stories that held your ways of being in place don't need to be there anymore. And so, who then am I?</p>
  
    <p>Now that the psyche is unrooting itself, deeper and more intense experiences will surface too, whether you like it or not. The fundamental fears about yourself and the world will be a part of your day.</p>

    <p>Soon too that dissolves in truth. And your mind is quiet. At last.</p>

    <p>It is a painful path. And even when you are all said and done, the world isn't.</p>
 
    <p>There is screaming and laughing everywhere.</p>

    <p>-</p>

    <p>How do physical tension and experiential constriction relate? Why does opening the hip release emotion?</p>

    <p>A good way to think about it is from the groundless ground up.</p>
  
    <p>First, we start with the eternal. Nirvana.</p>
  
    <p>Then, there’s movement and us.</p>
  
    <p>Think back to a time when you were angry or anxious. Very unsettled right?</p>
  
    <p>That unsettling is the created construction of suffering.</p>
  
    <p>What this means is that when you are in a flow state or deep contemplation, everything is water.</p>
  
    <p>These negative experiences are ripples in said water. And once there’s a ripple, it’s quite hard to predict how that will unfold.</p>
  
    <p>So what is the ocean? The ocean is what you see. And sense. And think. And feel.</p>
  
    <p>It doesn’t matter how a wave comes, but that it must go. That unsettling is you not letting go. A paradox, but that’s how it works.</p>
  
    <p>A calm surface will ensconce every ripple with beauty.</p>

    <p>-</p>

    <p>If you want to be more creative, all you have to do is let your mind be as it is more. No intent, and no running away from bad thoughts and memories.</p>
    
    <p>You just have to let yourself express yourself more. That’s it really.</p>
    
    <p>Ask yourself why you’re so scared to do that and the map will reveal itself.</p>
    
    <p>To a deeper, fuller engagement with reality and her treasures.</p>
    
    <p>-</p>

    <p>Bitch you think I’m joking when I say you have to wander?</p>
    
    <p>I’ve lost years of my life wondering. Lost my youth lost in pain.</p>
    
    <p>But that’s how it works, isn’t it?</p>
    
    <p>Suffering navigates the world, the pain breaks you down, and then you’re dragged through time.</p>
    
    <p>What is lost becomes moveless moving, which is what you need to be the flow.</p>
    
    <p>The way is there. Everything is here. That is the union with God. Everything is lost in light.</p>
    
    <p>And darkness no more.</p>
