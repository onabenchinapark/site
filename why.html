    <p>What does it mean to be?</p>
    <p>To be a part of this world?</p>
    <p>To be human?</p>
    <p>And to be me?</p>
    <p>Why? Why this? How this?</p>
    <p>Who knows! But we’re still here, aren’t we?</p>
    <p>And what a haunting, fascinating mystery that is.</p>
    <p>That’s what this is. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
    <p>You’re reading the words of someone just living. Someone who can’t stop asking why, for better and worse.</p>
    <p>The wandering and wondering has taken me on some journeys, and I’ve found some things along the way. I’ve seen a lot of things too. And I’d like to share this beauty and story with you.</p>
    <p>And if you're looking for a manifesto...</p>
    <p>I am a mystic poet. Everything I write and think has been revealed to me through my intimate relationship with reality. I have privileged access to her secrets through our love language that is experience.<p>
    <p>We are at a historical time of re-mystification. The machine god beckons. And with all annihilation of structure, opportunity is fertile. For meaning-making to rise in the right ways. That is enlightenment. We are the age of awakening.<p>
    <p>Our language is one of science and technology. That has taken us far. But we are soon reaching its limits. This is where that too transcends in the light of the divine.<p> 
    <p>For too long, enlightenment has been a myth, a secret treasure recognized by the few. But it’s always been there. It is always here. It is now time for the creation of a modern transmission of awakening.<p>
    <p>Consciousness! What is it? Who are we? What is life, and living?<p>
    <p>Who knows? But it’s of the utmost importance that the universe’s wisdom is maintained, uncorrupted by our stories and stupidity.<p>
    <p>This is where I come in. On the edge of the known, trying to bring back what I've seen.</p>
    <p>I have been through the wringer, through pain and deep contemplation, to see suffering and humanity. And I am sharp enough to translate the ineffable into something closer for the modern mind.<p>
    <p>I know this sounds crazy. I more than understand, and agree with you. That I am also crazy. And you're right. It is. I am.</p>
    <p>In many ways, I hope I come across that way. But please know that all of this is coming from a place of pure curiosity. That’s it really. I’d really just like to dedicate much of my life to exploration and see what I come back with, and share it with all of you.<p>
    <p>Many of you have been doing the same. To exploring, and letting experience transform you. It is in this journey that we find truth, share our stories, and meet love in ourselves and each other. And what a journey that can be.</p>
    <p>So, fellow traveler, here’s to going where the wild things are. For we are the fools brave enough to listen.</p>
    <p>I hope to meet you there.</p>
