        <h1>I AM A MADMAN.</h1>

        <p>I think something good and dangerous to do is to be creating self-mythos while you live. Sometimes a walk needs to be more than a walk.</p>
        <p>What’s scary though is that this self-aggrandizing is a way to imagine and to escape. But that’s not such a bad thing either. I suppose one thing to refine is your ability to dance between what’s real and what’s not.</p>
        <p>But what is real? This is where that mythos meets reality. You create one story and suddenly the world is beautiful, and then something happens that shatters that. Call it an illusion, story, meaning-making, whatever; I don’t think it hurts to make more than what is there.</p>
        <p>And through this process of creation and destruction, something magical seems to happen. This newfound ability to see. It’s weird how it works like that, but it does. And it’s terrifying too.</p>
        <p>A mind stuck in the mundane seems to be trapped by the failures of what is, but a mind that journeys both seems to see what is for what it really is. And can be.</p>
        <p>What is a madman but someone who laughs among the stars?</p>
