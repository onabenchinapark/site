    <p>Do what you must to accept everything. That is the secret. Only then will you know peace. And the love that has always been. For you are, time and time again.<p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>Imagine a swirl of rose petals. Really see the pink and red and the air of it all. Then, let yourself become it. Let your mind spin and follow the winds.</p>
    <p>You will always find your way. Sometimes, we need to see chaos for the beauty it says.</p>
    <p>Now imagine the waves crashing down. Over and over again. Relive the eternal of it all.</p>
    <p>You will always be your way. For the raptures and ruptures are what frees and captures.</p>
    <p>Now see the sun and sky. Feel the light on your skin. Witness the rays for the truths they show.</p>
    <p>The way is always free. It is bliss and peace. It is wrath and fire.</p>
    <p>And that, is me.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>Surrender is an evocative term. Rather, when you feel something bad, just say okay. And then, what now?</p>
    <p>That’s all you have to do. And that’s what you’ve been doing all along.</p>
    <p>So it’s okay to go fast. It’s okay to go slow. You are always this beautiful story of you.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>You must wander to find your way.</p>
    <p>Walk. Don’t talk.</p>
    <p>Every time there is a crossroads, struggle.</p>
    <p>Feel what your heart says.</p>
    <p>See what your mind feels.</p>
    <p>Then pick.</p>
    <p>Or don’t.</p>
    <p>And keep going.</p>
    <p>Do this over and over again.</p>
    <p>And that is how you find your way.</p>
    <p>So you see you are the path.</p>
    <p>So what is this way?</p>
    <p>That has always been.</p>
    <p>That you are.</p>
    <p>Just keep going.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>Still your mind and body.</p>
    <p>Let the finite show.</p>
    <p>And rest and struggle and be.</p>
    <p>Then move.</p>
    <p>Move in the ways the universe tells you.</p>
    <p>That is how you follow the mystical winds.</p>
    <p>Do this time and time again.</p>
    <p>And that is how you find the eternal waves.</p>
    <p>Now laugh and cry at the endless love.</p>
    <p>For you are me.</p>
    <p>Infinite free.</p>
