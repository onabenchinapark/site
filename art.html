    <p>I listen to reality</p>
    <p>Today it told me</p>
    <p>What I knew to be God</p>
    <p>I met in another soul</p>

    <p>___</p>
    
    <p>The greatest mistake of my life was believing that I was alone. It took losing everything to realize I had nothing to lose. That I was always love.</p>
    
    <p>___</p>

    <p>And yet, within this cosmic dance, there is something deeply personal.
    <p>Even in the wrestling, there is reverence.</p>

    <p>What are we but cosmic gamblers, drawn by this erotic pull toward existence?</p>
    <p>The danger isn’t insanity; it’s illusion and annihilation.</p>

    <p>Because beneath all of it, something more fundamental remains:</p>

    <p>A clarity that cannot be undone.</p>
    <p>A knowing that will never fade.</p>
    <p>A truth that, no matter how much you play with chaos, endures.</p>

    <p>That is who you are.</p>

    <p>Divine play, a sacred madness.</p>
