    <p>look into the non-duality of non-duality. what is the paradox of and within paradox?</p>

    <p>just follow your thoughts and urges don’t be scared now</p>

    <p>either you go fully into the illusion to see through the absurdity of the mind’s compulsion</p> 
    
    <p>or you burn through all your conditioning so there’s nothing left to cling on to</p>
    
    <p>or both</p>
    
    <p>doesn't matter how you get there truth is always there</p>

    <h1>111</h1>
    <p>the right craziness is always more sanity.</p>

    <p>the mastery is in discernment of chaos.</p>
