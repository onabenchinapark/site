    <p>This is my open journal of awakening.</p>  
    <p>The purpose of my work will always be this. Just living. Being, becoming, and expressing all that is.<p>
    <p>That is this body of work. And so here are some ways this will look:</p>
    <p>- contemplations on living, awakening, the mind, and more</p>
    <p>- artistic writings on the human condition, love, suffering, and what it means to be</p>
    <p>- practical meditations to follow for anyone on their path</p>
    <p>- explorations and research into the nature of consciousness and reality</p>
    <p>- applications of contemplative insight, focused on transdisciplinary approaches of reducing suffering and increasing wellbeing</p>
    <p>Here is the grander vision:</p>
    <p>- a knowledge base of enlightenment; how can we effectively share our best wisdom, practices, experiences, and more at large?</p>
    <p>- a meta-entity of collective wisdom; how can we scale trust and meaning and coordination in the right ways?</p>
