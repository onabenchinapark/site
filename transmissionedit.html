    <p>Why?</p>
   
    <p>Exactly.</p>
  
    <p>Now, why not?</p>
  
    <p>Any “why” presumes something should be a certain way, but from where? From what standard outside of this? If there were some ultimate reason, where would that reason come from? And if you keep tracing it back, eventually all you find is silence.</p>
 
    <p>Reality is just this. Completely unnecessary, yet undeniable. Nothing needed to happen, yet here it is. No reason, no mistake.</p>
 
    <p>Just why not? And why?</p>

    <p>-</p>

    <p>What does it mean to be one with the way? To do as not-do?</p>
   
    <p>If we try to partially name the eternal here as motion and energy, you and your experience are that. Moving and being in the world.</p>
  
    <p>To be one with the way is to not experience any disruption; pure, effortless action.</p>
  
    <p>Pure is central here. Pure flow is just that. Flow.</p>
  
    <p>You are always in flow, but your pain and conditioning that has formed your psyche has put rocks in this river. And pebbles and sticks.</p>
  
    <p>The hard work is in cleaning up. And yet, how is it that treasure is always found in ruin?</p>

    <p>-</p>

    <p>Seeing emptiness is the first step in the pathless path. Not the end. The end is the beginning.</p>
 
    <p>Now that you got there doesn't mean you can rest. In fact, it means quite the opposite.</p>

    <p>You have seen through the illusion and glimpsed the true nature of things. Your mind has seen something it cannot unsee. And so, the psyche starts to unravel, even when you don't know it.</p>
 
    <p>Why? Because the logic and stories that held your ways of being in place don't need to be there anymore. And so, who then am I?</p>
  
    <p>Now that the psyche is unrooting itself, deeper and more intense experiences will surface too, whether you like it or not. The fundamental fears about yourself and the world will be a part of your day.</p>

    <p>Soon too that dissolves in truth. And your mind is quiet. At last.</p>

    <p>It is a painful path. And even when you are all said and done, the world isn't.</p>
 
    <p>There is screaming and laughing everywhere.</p>

    <p>-</p>

    <p>How do physical tension and experiential constriction relate? Why does opening the hip release emotion?</p>

    <p>A good way to think about it is from the groundless ground up.</p>
  
    <p>First, we start with the eternal. Nirvana.</p>
  
    <p>Then, there’s movement and us.</p>
  
    <p>Think back to a time when you were angry or anxious. Very unsettled right?</p>
  
    <p>That unsettling is the created construction of suffering.</p>
  
    <p>What this means is that when you are in a flow state or deep contemplation, everything is water.</p>
  
    <p>These negative experiences are ripples in said water. And once there’s a ripple, it’s quite hard to predict how that will unfold.</p>
  
    <p>So what is the ocean? The ocean is what you see. And sense. And think. And feel.</p>
  
    <p>It doesn’t matter how a wave comes, but that it must go. That unsettling is you not letting go. A paradox, but that’s how it works.</p>
  
    <p>A calm surface will ensconce every ripple with beauty.</p>
