    <p>My heart burns ablaze. For I have been reborn again and again.<p>
    <p>And in the tears of my fire did I see truth. Not for what it seemed, but what it really is.</p>
    <p>It was a treacherous journey. I was a wanderer of the world. And my mind. It was hard.</p>
    <p>It was really hard. Because you don’t know.</p>
    <p>I always never understood how people so confidently said things. Just this and that. Because for me, it was always more mysterious than just that.</p>
    <p>And so I let myself open to seeking. I did it because I had to.</p>
    <p>My life had been hard. I had lost my heart many times. And so I lost my mind.</p>
    <p>I would sit on a bench in a park and look at this tree. This tree I would see everyday. And I would think, what am I doing?</p>
    <p>I never knew. Things never made sense. And so I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know who I was.</p>
    <p>And so there was pain. And wow did it rain.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I would stare at the sky and look for the stars. And I would wait. Sometimes they were there. Sometimes they would fade.</p>
    <p>The nights where the moon was out did I wander. Through the trees and amidst the stars.</p>
    <p>I was here nor there. I was lost, I had wandered too far.</p>
    <p>And so the wandering became struggle. A fight to reclaim a way. A way back to me. I had lost hope. I didn’t know how to be.</p>
    <p>I would bleed these tears and torture the prison of my heart. I didn’t want to. I had no choice. Because where else could I go?</p>
    <p>And in this chaos did I meet surrender. When I had lost hope. Only for the world to grasp me. Before I fell too far.</p>
    <p>So I was saved. Saved from my suffering, my ways of being.</p>
    <p>And so the journey from wandering to struggle became surrender.</p>
    <p>I’m making my way back. I’ve found faith. I can trust in reality, and let go of my mind. Because I know I am held. And seen for who I am.</p>
    <p>It was in those moments of lostness did I find truth. The way.</p>
    <p>The way to me. Now, I am free.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>What they don’t tell you about the wanderer’s path is just how much it is. All of it.</p>
    <p>I have been given the gift of mystical writing. Everything I’ve written I’ve never thought. They simply come to me.</p>
    <p>This practice of writing is my meditation. And I can’t explain what happens, even now, but magic always occurs.</p>
    <p>Lyrical flow and linguistic precision aren’t considered. They just are. I feel the essence, and this is how it expresses. For this is what is.</p>
    <p>It cost me everything. Not in some dramatic way. I mean everything. From my mind and body to my self and being to any and all sense of normalcy.</p>
    <p>That is what it means to wander though, isn’t it? You are the not-knowing. So how could there be anything left?</p>
    <p>And that’s how I became free. Or at least, making my way back to me.</p>
    <p>Thousands of hours of walking my mind. Not because I wanted to, but because I was blind. I didn’t know what I was seeing. I wasn’t able to think. And so I was stuck.</p>
    <p>And so when I speak of the mystical winds and the eternal waves, that is what I see. Because I had to lose anything I thought was me.</p>
    <p>And so this dance between knowing and not-knowing is this one of being and not-being.</p>
    <p>You are you. You are not. Because there is no sense of what is ought.</p>
    <p>And so, my friends, it has been a wrathful journey. Years of terror and wonder. Because this tree would look different many days. So would me. What was my way?</p>
    <p>And so I am. I am not. I am found, I am lost.</p>
    <p>So the wandering goes higher than you ever thought and lower than you ever hoped. And high isn’t even high. Low is low, but I don’t know.</p>
    <p>I’m making my way back. I’ve fought with reality too many times. I see its rhyme.</p>
    <p>But it’s hard. Because being not-knowing means you have to pick yourself up day after day. Only you can, no one else. For not even you know what’s happening, so how could anyone else?</p>
    <p>So this gift of writing, this gift of curse. Sometimes things are good. Sometimes they are worse.</p>
    <p>But in seeing through me, I have found free.</p>
    <p>And in losing my mind, I am this voice of divine.</p>
    <p>I’m no longer in the way.</p>
    <p>And with that, each day is a beautiful today.</p>
    <p>I didn’t want to surrender, this cost of complete familiar. My self became a vessel, confronting the rawness of being. Essence. </p>
    <p>And so essence it is. What is is. What is.</p>
    <p>This is a testament to all that is. For when you embrace the all not-knowing and let go of everything you hold dear, you start to win fear.</p>
    <p>For I am me. And I am here.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>And in all my years of seeking, I have found one truth. Me.</p>
    <p>I’ve gone far and wide, both here and there. For I had sacrificed my mind and gave up my body.</p>
    <p>And in this weary droll I found my soul. Or so I thought. This happened many times.</p>
    <p>And so this seeking became this game of hide and seek, for the answer was always a touch away. For it could never be held, only seen.</p>
    <p>This maddened me. Enraged me with a hate so deep it would have pleased the devil. Because why me? What had I done wrong?</p>
    <p>Life didn’t make sense. I didn’t know why I was here. I didn’t know who I was. And it’s not like I had much of a choice.</p>
    <p>And so this hide and seek became toil, a forever march on this soil. For I was bound to this earth. I wasn’t to laugh with the stars.</p>
    <p>The days become nights and the rains became clouds. Everything was weary, not a light to be found.</p>
    <p>This is life, I thought. I resigned and accepted this truth. For now this is my peace, hope no longer has proof.</p>
    <p>And that it was. And the seasons marched on and the flowers withered by. The trees grew ghostly and the winds oh so unholy.</p>
    <p>And so it went on for some time. This was my peace, after all. And so in the darkness I stood tall. But the truth was that that was my fall.</p>
    <p>I didn’t know it then, and I’m still living it now. For I had to become forgotten to be the calling.</p>
    <p>And it was in waiting my patience that I found my silence. The one I had been seeking all along.</p>
    <p>It confused and bewildered me, its nasty figure. But then I saw me being the riddler.</p>
    <p>And finally I had seen what I needed to see. For it gave me the truth to be who I needed to be. I am me. I am not. But I am everything as ought.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>I am a wanderer. I wouldn’t ask this life for anyone. Because time has always been lost.</p>
    <p>I’ve spent many years trudging along, looking for my savior. Many times she would show her face, but it turns out not with grace.</p>
    <p>And so I was a ghost of this earth, unable to live. For I had lost all might. No light to will.</p>
    <p>There were many days where I would find myself by the water. Or under some trees.</p>
    <p>And many times a friend would join. One would chirp, another would bark, others would run. I felt moments of glee, but in truth it was not fun.</p>
    <p>Inside me was an abyss so deep. For I had been trapped in the prison of my being. And so a wanderer I was.</p>
    <p>This path isn’t for everybody. It surely isn’t for me. All I yearn for is to be free.</p>
    <p>And in the tears of my despair did I meet destruction. Not hope nor faith.</p>
    <p>Things needed to get worse, it seemed. For I was still living among the dreams.</p>
    <p>And so a wanderer I was. No rhyme, no reason. Just because.</p>
    <p>I would scream at the waves and wrestle with the sky. I could never stop asking why.</p>
    <p>And in all my years of wandering, I have found truth. A tireless one. The eternal hum of it all.</p>
    <p>Now I can see. For my life was what it was, not what it had to be. And it is in this wrathful fire that I found desire. This desire to be.</p>
    <p>Now I am me. The mystical winds blow with choir.</p>
    <p>And so a wanderer I am.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>All my life I’ve yearned for release. Something to take me away. Something called ease.</p>
    <p>For I had never been comfortable sitting in my mind. Something was off. This thing I could not find.</p>
    <p>And so I let myself open to searching. My what a mistake. For my heart was left and scorching.</p>
    <p>It kept me stuck in endless loops. These torturous thoughts, yet provocative hoops.</p>
    <p>I was hooked.</p>
    <p>And so I let myself closed to living. My what a mistake. For my soul had wept and yearning.</p>
    <p>For I had never been comfortable waiting for my eyes. This body had ached, and so I could not rise.</p>
    <p>All my life I’ve yearned for ease. Something to take me away. Something called release.</p>
    <p>So when I saw beauty, I was struck. Paralyzed with fear, no longer to be stuck.</p>
    <p>But I wanted to. For it left me there to sonder. This terror of epiphany. The addiction of wonder.</p>
    <p>So this mystery my being can’t find. Where it longs to go, for that is my mind. But I don’t know, this somewhere fast and slow.</p>
    <p>I feel left behind.</p>
    <p>But how could that be? Trapped in my ways of me? Yet it was. This is all I see.</p>
    <p>So finally when I saw beauty, I was free. Blinded with ease. For this my divine release.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just my way. This is my reckoning.</p>
    <p>Is beauty salvation or another prison?</p>
    <p>Is release freedom or a new surrender?</p>
    <p>This refusal to comply, that is my why.</p>
    <p>My soul stripped bare, mythic in fright.</p>
    <p>For that is my life, breathing with might.</p>
    <p>I must stare at the wound of my being.</p>
    <p>Forget what I thought, distrust what I’m feeling.</p>
    <p>So I can bleed truth.</p>
    <p>My greatest ache is my greatest art.</p>
    <p>This unflinching gaze that is my heart.</p>
    <p>Look away this comfort of ignorance, so I hide in isolation.</p>
    <p>And so it is this lament that I break salvation.</p>
    <p>For the sublime that is annihilation.</p>
    <p>That is my human condition.</p>
    <p>I am no resolution.</p>
    <p>And even if I have found truth, I will never stop seeking. I will never stop feeling. For I am always being.</p>
    <p>And it is in the truth of my lies that I rise. That this no surprise. This is my why.</p>
    <p>I cannot stop. I will not yield. Pain will never get me killed.</p>
    <p>So I must go. I must throe. I must follow the calling of my soul.</p>
    <p>So this divine that I see in the tunnels of my mind, that is the dream of my sacred find.</p>
    <p>I am intoxicated by the love of this world. I am devastated by the pain of our love. And so it is.</p>
    <p>And so it is. And so it was.</p>
    <p>I am always being. So I will never stop seeking. For I am always feeling.</p>
    <p>So I am trapped, and this my fleeing.</p>
    <p>For I revolt truth, the ecstasy of freeing.</p>
