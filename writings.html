    <p>To love and be loved is to be destroyed by it. I’m realizing that now.<p>
    <p>It’s an impossible ask, for two to be one. Because each one is always becoming. So two isn’t even real. Neither is one.</p>
    <p>But it is. And there’s that love so deep and so profound that it shakes us to our cores. Because it awakens and moves the parts we shunned and forgot long ago.</p>
    <p>We are already whole. And not at the same time. And someone else who’s just as messy comes along. And then suddenly whole doesn’t even matter. Because things are perfect. Truly perfect as it is.</p>
    <p>And so this perfection shines a light on our deepest depths. Our deepest wounds and our deepest selves. But that’s a scary thing. Terrifying, in fact.</p>
    <p>But you have to. And you will. Because that is her. Reality. Everything.</p>
    <p>And so you bleed the weary tears and let the heart fall from the highs to the lows. Because the highs are so high there never was a low to begin with.</p>
    <p>And so it’s this messy, luminous collision of two souls daring to see each other fully.</p>
    <p>Yes, it’s devastating. Love strips us bare and forces us to meet the exiled parts of us in the mirror that is the other. But that terror is also grace. For those highs above high is love transcending fear.</p>
    <p>They aren’t separate from the lows. They are the same. The fights and laughs is the wounds and awakening.</p>
    <p>So you bleed. You tremble. You let the heart break open again and again. Not because love is a destruction, but because it is the only thing able to hold all that is ourselves.</p>
    <p>And so we must break all that isn’t for all that is.</p>
    <p>And in this love, there is the truth that love doesn’t make us whole. It makes us real.</p>
    <p>The choice is yours. It always has been.</p>
    <p>But if you say yes—Oh, if you say yes.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>It is in the vast, indifferent universe that we come to know our nothingness. That we are truly nothing.</p>
    <p>And yet, the greatest wonder is how that is everything.</p>
    <p>To live and to die, and to be weak and frail is what makes us us. For how else could we hold something so precious in our hands?</p>
    <p>And so in this meaninglessness is love. The world too marches on, and he grows weary of the burdens of his journeys. For the world feels the weight of itself because it is.</p>
    <p>And in this weary and toil we meet the divine. The beauty and grace of reality and her touch.</p>
    <p>We are but the same. We are so weak and so controlled by pain that we are love and free to be.</p>
    <p>And in this everlasting dance, and all the ones that flicker in and out, is the everything of nothing.</p>
    <p>So do not be afraid to fear and to laugh. Our capacity to feel is our greatest weakness and strength. After all, it is what makes us us.</p>
    <p>And do not be afraid to live. For things fall apart and come together time and time again. What is and what could be are all a part of the story of stories. And you will always be you.</p>
    <p>For better and for worse.</p>

    <p>Love is fundamental because life is fundamental.</p>
    <p>Me and the world. Me and others. Me and myself. We live in connection.</p>
    <p>We don’t need to understand its nature to see it. To feel it and acknowledge its truth.</p>
    <p>But the mind is a tricky thing. And so we try to seek. We ask, what is love and who am I?</p>
    <p>The illusion was that everything wasn’t love.</p>
    <p>We trap our beings into what we think to be true, and it is to no fault of our own that we think connection to be the same. That it has to be this way. Or a certain way. And certainly not that.</p>
    <p>And so we blind ourselves from light. Because connection is not just what you think it to be.</p>
    <p>Think again to me and the world. Me and others. Me and myself. What is me? And the world?</p>
    <p>Every thing you see and feel and think is connected in some way. And not just in some way, but in every way.</p>
    <p>And it is in this radical view of connection that reveals love to be everywhere. Because you were never alone after all.</p>
    <p>And you are free. What is pain but the sense of feeling some thing? Some thing that just wants to fly. And yet we trap it, so it cries.</p>
    <p>There’s no need to trap, no need for why. You can just be, and not ask who am I.</p>
    <p>Now everything is imbued with light. Reality in the dead of winter is warm with the hands of God.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>We are but simple beings. Caught in our dreams, seeking what’s deep. And searching for truth.</p>
    <p>So we create. Me and more me’s. What is to be?</p>
    <p>And so we yearn. Who pulls our wounded strings? To free in a world trapped by me.</p>
    <p>We fight and hurt and wonder why I did that. Sometimes it was worth it. It never really was.</p>
    <p>We chase what’s good and feels whole. Writing magical tales of a simple tree.</p>
    <p>And so we quest and pray for an end. Something to make it all go away. And maybe okay. But that’s for another day.</p>
    <p>And so we live and ride our wildest fears. I wonder what’s near.</p>
    <p>For it’s the truth I bear. We are but simple beings.</p>
    
    <p>-</p>
    <p>To live is to paint the canvas of your being; to write the lyric of your soul; to sing the tears of the heart</p>
    <p>You are the space between what was and what’s to be - a tempest of opportunity, filled with infinite wonder and peril.</p>
    <p>Be the artist of your mind! Scribble all over and draw on the textures of sound and the shapes of emotion and the waves of sentience, and see what masterpiece emerges.</p>
    <p>That masterpiece that is you. A manifesto of pure creation and destruction, over and over and over again. Until your last dying breath, as you wander off into the wild…</p>
    <p>Remember as you explore, you are both lost and found. Free and bound. Argue with the edges of your world and see how reality negotiates.</p>
    <p>Experience is but a beast, you are the monster and the tamed. The warden of your dreams, the conductor of your visions. Of what is. Of what will. And of what was told.</p>
    <p>Do not fear the power of your being.</p>
    <p>Do not temper the fire of your soul:</p>
    <p>A mystery that knows no end.</p>
    <p>You are a story of revelation;</p>
    <p>A true declaration of becoming.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>Suffering is the fear of uncertainty, and everything we do to keep that at bay.</p>
    <p>It makes no sense, because the unknown is certain. Everything else isn’t. And so we hold on so tight to what we know and what we think is right and what we think is me.</p>
    <p>But I don’t know how to not be scared. I don’t know how to not be angry at the world about my pain. And I see everyone else too, doing the same thing.</p>
    <p>Many times I’ve asked, why God? Why this? What is this? How am I supposed to be okay with all of this?</p>
    <p>There is no answer that’s good enough. There is no answer that makes the suffering worth it.</p>
    <p>And yet, we dance. And sing. And cry and love.</p>
    <p>The pursuit of understanding is what we do. And it’s gotten us quite far. But what now? When the questions never end?</p>
    <p>I suppose all we can do is find embrace in the world and each other; for the pursuit of happiness is not to understand, but to be.</p>
    <p>And that pursuit is whatever it takes to get there. And what a journey that can be.</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>I like living a story. Now that suffering has been mostly tamed, I find myself wanting it to be an element of my being. Who knew it would turn out this way? Lol</p>
    <p>I like drugs and the euphoria and pain it brings. I like the journey it takes me on, as messed up as it is. I like being weird and fucked in the head. Why? Because that’s who I am.</p>
    <p>I’ve spent a lifetime hating myself and now that I don’t but also don’t really give a fuck, life has been a wonderful exploration and series of self-experiments to see how bad bad can get and how good good is.</p>
    <p>Of course, it took everything in me to get here. And more. I’ve come so close to a willing death - to the true absence of hope.</p>
    <p>That singular moment when I fully gave up was the necessary surrender to ignite the alchemy. I remember it so clearly now. When surrender became salvation.</p>
    <p>So what is there to fear really when you’ve been kidnapped into the lower realms? When you’ve had no choice but to figure out what the actual fuck was going on in your head to find a way through?</p>
    <p>Well it turns out a lot of things; but what I fear no more is my lack of faith. Beyond my soul, that I am.</p>
    <p>I decided to stop being bad for a few days and yeah my body is much better and my mind is much clearer and my emotions and thoughts are much more manipulatable and I’m just more able - but where’s the fun in that?</p>
    <p>There’s a time and place for everything, and for me, as soon as my dark night is over it’s so over for you bitches</p>
    <p>But maybe I don’t want the darkness to end, because it is my friend; because I’m no longer its victim, but a willing participant.</p>
    <p>I suppose, at the end of the day, maybe I was just born the wild.</p>
